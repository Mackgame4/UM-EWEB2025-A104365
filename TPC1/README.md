## Results
The code shows a high capacity of error handling and content serving.

Firstly we need to have installed the node json-server:
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

and use, to start the json-server on `port 3000`:
```bash
npm run json-server
```

Next we need to pick the given json file for this TPC and parse it into a better format for the json-server. That can be achieved using:
```bash
npm run json
```

And finally to start and check the web page served via nodejs and http server we can use:
```bash
npm start
```
